    <h4>What is DSA</h4>
    <pre>In the context of computers, the data structure is a specific way of storing and organizing data in the computer's memory so that these data can be easily retrieved and efficiently used when needed later. </pre><br>

    <h4>Why Create Data Structures?</h4>
    <pre>Data structures serve a number of important functions in a program. They ensure that each line of code performs its function correctly and efficiently, they help the programmer identify and fix problems with his/her code, and they help to create a clear and organized code base.</pre><br>

    <h4>Explain the process behind storing a variable in memory.</h4>
    <pre>->A variable is stored in memory based on the amount of memory that is needed. Following are the steps followed to store a variable:
              ->The required amount of memory is assigned first.
              ->Then, it is stored based on the data structure being used.
        ->Using concepts like dynamic allocation ensures high efficiency and that the storage units can be accessed based on requirements in real-time</pre><br>
